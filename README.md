# NEXT WORD PREDICTION USING GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS(GNN)
**Developed a predictive model for next word suggestion in sentences using Graph Neural Networks.
**Designed and implemented a Graph Neural Network to capture the syntactic structure of sentences.
**Preprocessed text data to create word embeddings and adjacency matrices representing sentence structure.
**Trained the model on a large text corpus to predict the next word in a sequence with high accuracy.
**Evaluated model performance using metrics such as perplexity and accuracy, and optimized hyperparameters for improved results.
**Successfully reduced perplexity scores, indicating improved language model performance.
**Enhanced model accuracy through iterative experimentation and refinement of the GNN architecture.
