# NEXT WORD PREDICTION USING GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS(GNN)â€¢	Developed a predictive model for next word suggestion in sentences using Graph Neural Networks.
_ Designed and implemented a Graph Neural Network to capture the syntactic structure of sentences.
_ Preprocessed text data to create word embeddings and adjacency matrices representing sentence structure.
_	Trained the model on a large text corpus to predict the next word in a sequence with high accuracy.
_ Evaluated model performance using metrics such as perplexity and accuracy, and optimized hyperparameters for improved results.Successfully reduced perplexity scores,            indicating improved language model performance.
_ Enhanced model accuracy through iterative experimentation and refinement of the GNN architecture.
